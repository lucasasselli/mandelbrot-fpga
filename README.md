# Madelbrot FPGA  
  
## Introduction  
*Mandelbrot FPGA* is an FPGA implementation for a calculator and visualizer of the homonimous [mathematical set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set "mathematical set"). The logic was designed using Mathworks Simulink HDL Coder for the Terasic DE10-Nano Board.  
This project is the result of a bad flu, an unhelathy fascination with fractals and to much spare time.  
  
## Features  
- 1280x720p  resolution
- 60 FPS  
- 128 Mandelbrot iterations  
- 18 bit fixed point architecture.  

## Contents  

 - Sample OpenGL application to explore the Mandelbrot set
 - Quartus DE10 Nano project
 - Simulink project for the core logic
